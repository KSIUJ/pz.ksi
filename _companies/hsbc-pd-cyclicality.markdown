The purpose of this project would be to investigate the strength of the relation between economic cycles and expected loss on credit measured by one of its components. The component mentioned would be the Probability of Default and its future realization – Observed Default Rate. You will conduct your analysis using classic statistical methods potentially enhanced by some modern techniques (e.g. machine learning). The correlation could be investigated at several levels, e.g. in aggregate, by industry, with time lag etc.
