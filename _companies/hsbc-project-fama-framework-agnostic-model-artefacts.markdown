The end-to-end management of machine learning lifecycle is very complex and, despite proliferation of ML methods, still remains a significant challenge.

Practitioners in the financial sector face a mosaic of inconsistent approaches with no single standard available from 3rd party vendors that could make them up the particular tasks:

- Monitor and compare ML experiments, their results and parameters used in calculations
- package ML models in reusable form and integrate within their corporate ecosystems
- manage and deploy model from a variety of ML libraries to local, internal platforms
- keep track of changes in data used in development cycles.

Majority of existing solutions are proprietary, language-specific or too narrow in their focus: tackling a single problem at a time. 

A novel, elastic and unified approach to a problem is paramount, especially for companies operating in the industries like financials where the governance of experiments is subject to the regulatory oversight.

The market gap has, however, not gone unnoticed. We are aware of several interesting developments in the field that starts to be known as DataOps. 

One of the most promising and interesting libraries is a ML flow library open-sourced by a Databricks (company behind Spark), see: http://mlflow.org, currently in alpha release. More will be shared as part of the project.

### Objective

Scholars will investigate if the library can meet specific HSBC criteria, will take a deep-dive into the design of the libraries and create a series of enhancements to adjust it to our corporate needs. These  created additions to the library could then be submitted as pull-requests and hence students would have  a chance to actively participate in the development of our internal, interactive ML tool. 

Students will get a real-life hands-on experience of end-to-end ML modelling lifecycle.
