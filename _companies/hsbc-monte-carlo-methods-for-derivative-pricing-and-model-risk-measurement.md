Financial mathematics has in recent years become one of the major applications areas of stochastic modelling. It draws on the one hand from a body of well-established theory, and on the other, it raises new problems and challenges, both from the theoretical and computational points of view. The core of the subject-matter of mathematical finance concerns questions of pricing of financial derivatives such as options and hedging (covering against “all” eventualities). 

Modern models of random stock price evolution have become so complex that analytical solutions usually are not accessible. Regarding pricing, it means that to solve the problem at hand we are compelled to apply numerical or Monte Carlo simulation techniques. 

The purpose of the project is to extend IMR (Independent Model Review) pricing library. Modules developed by the team will provide the answer to the following questions: what is the fair price of the pre-specified derivative instruments, how sensitive is the price to the small variation of model parameters. Students will apply discretization techniques to solve corresponding stochastic differential equations and variance reduction methods to make algorithms more efficient.
