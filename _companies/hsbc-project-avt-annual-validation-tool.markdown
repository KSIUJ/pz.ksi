Independent Model Review (IMR) department is reviewing a growing number of models every year. The review process covers the whole life-cycle of a model, from the development to the demise of each model. The review process is designed to answer a holistic question “Is the model applicable for it’s designed purpose?”. Answer to this question is usually complex and includes both qualitative (compliance with standards and regulations, appropriateness of methodology, etc.) and quantitative part (performing statistical tests).  As the number of models in Bank grows, IMR initiated several projects to automatize parts of the review process which are standard and repeatable.
The Annual Validation Tool is a project currently in beta testing phase on live models. The aim of the tool is to calculate standard tests performed on models which are already implemented and live in the Bank.

### Objective

Scholars will help expand the capabilities of the tool in terms of the span of calculated metrics and model types and help to enhance user experience by improving the user interface. The tool is implemented in SAS. No previous SAS experience is required (basic, hands-on training will be provided on site).
The project also involves improving the workflow structure, documentation and version control. Scholars can choose the area which is of particular interest, but will need to be involved in some coding.
