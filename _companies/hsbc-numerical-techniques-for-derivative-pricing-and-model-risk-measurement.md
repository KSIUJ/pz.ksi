company_desc: HSBC is one of the world’s largest banking and financial services organisations with over 51 million customers worldwide. Its global business spans Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Commercial Banking, Global Banking & Markets, and Private Banking. Managing the inherent risk in the financial products sold in each of these sectors requires a vast array of models. HSBC’s independent model review team is responsible for the validation of all of the models employed by HSBC.

Global Banking & Markets is HSBC’s investment banking arm. Its business depends heavily on the valuation of derivative contracts, used by investors to manage financial risks in currency exchange, interest rates, commodities, equity, and credit. As a successful candidate you will be part of HSBC’s derivative pricing model validation team. As a model validator you will independently implement derivative pricing models used in a live trading environment. This will involve model development, design, documentation, testing and finally implementation.

Implementing derivative pricing models requires knowledge of mathematics, numerical methods and programming. More precisely, the price-evolution of a derivative contract can in general be modelled by a partial-differential equation (PDE). Pricing a derivative contract and managing its risk will require you to develop an appropriate numerical scheme for solving the PDE, implement the scheme in code, and present and interpret the results. 

As a typical example, the price of European call option can be computed by numerically solving the famous Black-Scholes-Merton PDE. In order to price the derivative, the candidate would first need to choose an appropriate discretization of the continuous-time PDE. Once the grid of potential current and future prices of the underlying has been specified for the underlying asset, and the payoff of the option has been specified at the boundaries, the option price can be iteratively determined using either an explicit or implicit numerical method. The candidate would be expected to implement all of these steps (under supervision) and perform a comparative study for several derivative products, e.g., early exercise options, which may require more advanced numerical methods.
