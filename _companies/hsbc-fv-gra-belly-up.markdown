### Input 

The objective is to identify the best combination (read: weights) for various publically available variables applicable to the US and European corporates. Those should be combined based on data series to provide best predictors of possible corporate default or distress. 

The attached inputs may be based on:
    
- Sector / Rating / Market Cap information
- Periodic changes in credit spreads, shape of credit curves
- Price changes and volatility changes in primary and secondary (options) trading markets
- Amount of debt payable in a pre-defined short horizon
- Academic models, scoring models available in academia (e.g. Z-Score from NYU)
- Financial Ratios
- Information gathered from various public sources (e.g. Bloomberg, Reuters, Mark-it, Z-score identifier) might be made available to the faculty if necessary (TBD).
- Desired Output â€“ a credit score assigned to non-investment grade companies according to their probability of default in the nearby year. The companies with highest score can then be closely monitored within the bank with the idea of representation the highest risk, greatest possibility of default, restructuring or bankruptcy. 

### Objective

1. Build a model that would predict the default within the following 1-year horizon by using all the input arguments.
2. Suggest a set of up to 5 not-mentioned publicly available parameters that could be included to enrich the model and improve accuracy or back-testing prediction.
3. Document your model and calculations.
