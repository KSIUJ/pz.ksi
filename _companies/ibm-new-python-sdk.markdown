The goal of this project is to build open source technology in Python language in form of additional SDK for data scientist who could leverage that SDK to enrich AI governance solutions like IBM Cloud Pak For Data with additional metadata information that are in notebooks. This will allow to build comprehensive view of data from source systems down to AI models. The SDK will call REST API from IBM Cloud Pak for Data
